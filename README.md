# 🌃 TrueDarkMode
TrueDarkMode is a lightweight macOS menu bar utility app designed to take your Mac's dark mode to the next level where you have control.

#### Single click toggle based on your settings. 

# 🛠️ How to Use
#### Install: 
Download the .dmg file and move TrueDarkMode.app to your /Applications folder.

#### Authorize:
On the first run, macOS will protect you from an "Unknown Developer." 
Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll to the bottom, and click Allow Anyway for FortressMode.

#### Customize:
From the menu bar app, open the settings panel and customize the app based on your need.

#### Allow Permission:
On the first usage (toggle), macOS will ask your permission to allow this app to change system appearance. Please allow that for full functionality. 

# 🏗️ The Build Journey
This was my second macOS project and a consecutive one at that.
This was way simpler & much more fun this time than when I developed my first app (check it out here: https://github.com/aishwaryarana819/FortressMode).
