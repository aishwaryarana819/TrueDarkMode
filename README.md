# 🏗️ The Build Journey
This was my second macOS project and a consecutive one at that.
This was way simpler & much more fun this time than when I developed my first app (check it out here: https://github.com/aishwaryarana819/FortressMode).
Unlike last time, I have also added Start at Login feature, background image in the dmg file; simple things which make the user experience much better.
